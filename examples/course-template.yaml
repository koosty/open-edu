      ## What is Python?

      Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for:

      - **Easy to learn**: Clear, readable syntax
      - **Powerful**: Used by Google, NASA, Netflix
      - **Versatile**: Web, data science, AI, automation

      ## Installing Python

      1. Visit [python.org](https://python.org)

      # Variables and Data Types

      Learn how to store and work with data in Python.

      ## Variables

      Variables are containers for storing data:

      ```python
      name = "Alice"
      age = 25
      height = 5.6
      is_student = True
      ```

      ## Basic Data Types

      ### Numbers
      ```python
      integer = 42          # int
      decimal = 3.14        # float
      complex_num = 2 + 3j  # complex
      ```

      ### Strings
      ```python
      greeting = "Hello"
      message = 'World'
      multiline = """This is
      a multiline string"""
      ```

      ### Booleans
      ```python
      is_active = True
      is_complete = False
      ```

      ### Collections
      ```python
      # List (mutable)
      fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

      # Tuple (immutable)
      coordinates = (10, 20)

      # Dictionary (key-value pairs)
      person = {
          "name": "Bob",
          "age": 30
      }

      # Set (unique values)
      unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
      ```

      ## Type Conversion

      ```python
      # String to integer
      num = int("42")

      # Integer to string
      text = str(42)

      # String to float
      decimal = float("3.14")
      ```

      ## Practice Exercise

      Try creating variables of different types and converting between them!

  # Another lesson
  - title: "Control Flow: If Statements"
    type: "lesson"
    duration: "20 min"
    content: |
      # Control Flow: If Statements

      Make decisions in your code with conditional statements.

      ## Basic If Statement

      ```python
      age = 18

      if age >= 18:
          print("You are an adult")
      ```

      ## If-Else

      ```python
      temperature = 25

      if temperature > 30:
          print("It's hot!")
      else:
          print("It's comfortable")
      ```

      ## If-Elif-Else

      ```python
      score = 85

      if score >= 90:
          grade = "A"
      elif score >= 80:
          grade = "B"
      elif score >= 70:
          grade = "C"
      else:
          grade = "F"

      print(f"Your grade: {grade}")
      ```

      ## Comparison Operators

      - `==` : Equal to
      - `!=` : Not equal to
      - `>` : Greater than
      - `<` : Less than
      - `>=` : Greater than or equal
      - `<=` : Less than or equal

      ## Logical Operators

      ```python
      age = 25
      has_license = True

      if age >= 18 and has_license:
          print("You can drive")

      is_weekend = True
      is_holiday = False

      if is_weekend or is_holiday:
          print("You can relax!")
      ```

      ## Practice Challenge

      Write a program that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero!
